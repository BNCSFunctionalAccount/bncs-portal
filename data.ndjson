This driver will work with these router protocols: SWP-02 - Probel General Switcher SWP-08 - Probel General Remote Control N-Vision NP0016 – generic TCP/IP based Miranda controllers GV NP0017 / NV9000 for GV Convergent IP (device+level) routing NP0017 port based SDI routing using a variant of the GV protocol Quartz protocol for IP controlled Evertz routers and controllers,  including the ADMX Audio routers Harris Logical Router Controller for Imagine Routing Switchers and LRC+ for levels Nevion routers Black Magic routers Q.E.C Lband router protocol (limited command set) DracoTera – KVM Switch Lightware DVI Routers. The driver incorporates the extended protocol functionality within the latest additions for SWP-02 and SWP-08 protocols to work with the current range of Snell Series 800/850 routers along with Miranda hybrid routers which allow for router sizes up to 32000+destinations. The driver includes virtual routing functionality.","commerciallyAvailable":true, "roles":["Bloomberg", "Sky", "IMG", "Discovery"]}
