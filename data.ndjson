The connection is via an RS485 link, and theoretically a series of frames can be daisy-chained together to be accessed via a single PS RS422 port, but due to the sheer amount of data involved it is recommended that a single PC serial port be dedicated to each frame. Consequently the unit is currently limited to addressing a maximum of four cards. Assuming the addresses of the cards have correctly been configured in the ini file, the driver can cope with cards being dynamically added or removed from the system.","commerciallyAvailable":false, "roles":["BBC"]}

Rather than use RS232, it communicates over IP, using the SNMP protocol, meaning that you can easily run drivers for many units from one PC, without having the hassle of fitting a multi-port COM card, or similar. The driver does require that the IRD unit has SNMP control enabled. Current Tandberg units come with this enabled as standard. Older units may need it enabling, but Tandberg appear to offer the licence key for this feature free of charge. The slot layout is largely based on the original driver for backwards compatibility, although the feature set has grown to include the extra functions offered by the newer, HD and DVBS2 capable Tandberg products. In some cases, features not supported by the original driver (e.g. DVB-S/S2 switching) are added to unused slots, which may or may not conflict with slot usage in the original driver. The driver requires a V3 or V4 Infodriver to hook in to. The Infodriver must be already running when the driver is started. The driver has been written to control the TT1260 (including IPD units), TT1282, RX1290, and RX8200 IRD's. It has not been tested with TT1280's, although there is no reason why it should not work. There are several different combinations of main unit and demodulator/input cards. The following input cards have used during the writing and testing of the driver: TT1260 “QPSK Input Card” (DVB-S1), TT1260 “16QAM/8PSK (Newtec)” input card (DVB-S1), TT1260 “ASI Input Card”,  TT1260 “HO Demod.” input card (DVB-S1 8PSK capable card),  TT1260 “S2 Input V2” card (version without IF input, although IF input functionality should work.

Rather than use RS232, it communicates over IP, using the SNMP protocol, meaning that you can easily run drivers for many units from one PC, without having the hassle of fitting a multi-port COM card, or similar. The driver does require that the IRD unit has SNMP control enabled. Current Tandberg units come with this enabled as standard. Older units may need it enabling, but Tandberg appear to offer the licence key for this feature free of charge. The slot layout is largely based on the original driver for backwards compatibility, although the feature set has grown to include the extra functions offered by the newer, HD and DVBS2 capable Tandberg products. In some cases, features not supported by the original driver (e.g. DVB-S/S2 switching) are added to unused slots, which may or may not conflict with slot usage in the original driver. The driver requires a V3 or V4 Infodriver to hook in to. The Infodriver must be already running when the driver is started. The driver has been written to control the TT1260 (including IPD units), TT1282, RX1290, and RX8200 IRD's. It has not been tested with TT1280's, although there is no reason why it should not work.

The TTVENC driver was originally written to control the EN57xx series of MPEG encoders via SNMP over IP. It has since grown to include control of the optional RF Modulator cards, and to control the newer generation, but very similar EN8040 MPEG4/HD capable encoder modulators. Since the driver communicates over IP, using the SNMP protocol, drivers for many units may be run from one PC, without having the hassle of fitting a multi-port COM card, or similar. The driver does require that the encoder/modulator unit has SNMP control enabled. Current Tandberg units come with this enabled as standard. The driver requires a V3 or V4 Infodriver to hook in to. The Infodriver must be already running when the driver is started. The driver has been written as a “one driver fits all” application for several Tandberg (latterly Ericsson) encoder units, with a range of fitted hardware options (e.g. different types of modulator cards), and difference software enabled feature licences. Although there are physical differences in Tandberg units, such as different 1U or 2U form-factors, functionally, they are all very similar. The driver has been tested against the following combinations of hardware/software, although it should work with similar combinations, not listed below: EN5710 (1U form-factor), No RF Modulator, EN5714 (1U form-factor), DVB-SNG, L-Band Modulator, DVB-S2, L-Band Modulator, EN5720 (2U form-factor), No RF Modulator, EN8040 (2U form-factor), DVB-S2, 70MHz.
